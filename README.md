# Simple NBA

(Under construction)

Is a flutter-made app. It will show statistics and scoreboard for all NBA matches.
That information will be taken from a JSON file provided by [data.nba.net](http://data.nba.net/) website.

When tapping on a match card, it will show more information about the match.
